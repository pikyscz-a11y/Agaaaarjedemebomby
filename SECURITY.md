# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Measures

MoneyAgar.io implements comprehensive security measures to protect users, financial transactions, and gameplay integrity.

## 🛡️ Server-Authoritative Architecture

### Game Engine Security
- **All physics calculations** performed server-side
- **Client inputs** validated and rate-limited
- **Position updates** verified for physics compliance
- **Collision detection** and scoring handled exclusively on server
- **Anti-cheat heuristics** detect impossible movements and mass gains

### Spatial Validation
- Movement speed limits based on mass
- Teleportation detection and prevention
- Mass conservation validation
- Collision timing verification

## 💰 Financial Security

### Payment Processing
- **NOWPayments Integration**: Industry-standard USDT gateway
- **HMAC Signature Validation**: All webhooks cryptographically verified
- **Double-Entry Accounting**: All transactions logged and reconciled
- **Minimum Thresholds**: Deposit (1 USDT) and withdrawal (10 USDT) limits
- **Admin Approval**: Manual review for all payout requests

### Transaction Security
```python
# Webhook validation example
def validate_webhook(payload: str, signature: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha512
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected)
```

### Credit System
- **1:1 USDT Ratio**: Transparent credit-to-cryptocurrency conversion
- **Real-time Balance**: Credits updated immediately upon payment confirmation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with immutable records
- **Fee Transparency**: 2.5% withdrawal fee clearly disclosed

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Security
- **RS256 Algorithm**: Asymmetric key signing
- **Short Expiration**: 24-hour access tokens with refresh rotation
- **Secure Storage**: HttpOnly cookies for web, secure storage for mobile
- **Token Blacklisting**: Immediate revocation capability

### Password Security
- **bcrypt Hashing**: Industry-standard with configurable rounds
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters, complexity enforced
- **Rate Limiting**: Login attempt throttling
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary suspension after failed attempts

### Session Management
```python
# Session security example
@dataclass
class SecureSession:
    user_id: str
    created_at: datetime
    last_activity: datetime
    ip_address: str
    user_agent: str
    
    def is_valid(self) -> bool:
        return (
            datetime.utcnow() - self.last_activity < timedelta(hours=24)
            and not self.is_suspicious_activity()
        )
```

## 🌐 Network Security

### WebSocket Security
- **Origin Validation**: Strict CORS enforcement
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-connection message throttling
- **Connection Authentication**: JWT validation on WebSocket upgrade
- **Message Validation**: All incoming messages schema-validated

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per endpoint and user
- **Input Sanitization**: SQL injection and XSS prevention
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to authorized domains
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options

### DDoS Protection
```yaml
rate_limits:
  websocket_messages: 100/minute
  api_requests: 1000/hour
  login_attempts: 5/minute
  payment_requests: 10/hour
```

## 🏠 Infrastructure Security

### Container Security
- **Non-root Users**: All containers run as unprivileged users
- **Minimal Images**: Alpine-based with only required packages
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based configuration

### Database Security
- **Authentication Required**: MongoDB with role-based access
- **Encrypted Connections**: TLS for all database communication
- **Regular Backups**: Automated with encryption at rest
- **Access Logging**: All database operations audited

### Network Isolation
```yaml
networks:
  frontend_network:
    driver: overlay
    external: false
  backend_network:
    driver: overlay
    internal: true
  database_network:
    driver: overlay
    internal: true
```

## 🕵️ Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

audit_events = [
    'user_login', 'user_logout', 'password_change',
    'payment_received', 'withdrawal_requested', 'admin_action',
    'suspicious_activity', 'security_violation'
]
```
